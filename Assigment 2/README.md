Hello, my name is Jose Javier and I'll give you some tips.
In this reository you have the interactions.txt file that has the answer of the assigment, the html for the class used in this exercise, the program and class in rb format,
and the input file used in this assigment.

If you want to execute the programa you have to write in the linux terminal ruby followed by the program's name between quotes (Interactions_program.rb), the name of the input file
and the name of the output file between quotes too.
For example:
$ ruby Interactions_program.rb 'ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt' 'interactions.txt'

The program will give you the interactions that has the genes in the list.
