Hello my name is José Javier Tejeda Sánchez.

In this reopository you can find the following files:
1. The Program.
2. The class in rb and html.
3. The NoMatches report
4. The GFF3 files with the positions in the exon and in the gene.
5. Two screenshots ScreenshotAT2G46340.png that is the screenshot in the zone indicated in the exercise and the ScreenshotnearestIMageWithData.png which was the zone that
EMBL indicates me when I put the gff3 file.


If you want to run the program you have to write in the linux terminal ruby, followed by the gene sequence you want and the input file's name.
For examples: 
$ ruby GFF3Program.rb 'CTTCTT' 'ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt' 

The program will give you 'No_Matches_Report.txt', and the gff3 files.
