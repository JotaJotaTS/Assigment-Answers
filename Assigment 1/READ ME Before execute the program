Hello my name is Jose Javier Tejeda SÃ¡nchez.

To execute this program you have to write in the terminal after the name of the program and in this order the next names.
1st. the name of the gene tsv
2nd the name of the seed stock tsv
3rd the name of the cross tsv
4th the name of the new file you want to create with the new seed stock.
Example: 
ruby TejedaSanchezJoseJavierAssigment1.rb gene_information.tsv seed_stock_data.tsv cross_data.tsv New_file

I made the bonus activities too, to prove the geneID test you can enter in the gene tsv file and add what you want to test the test.
to the rest of bonus you can see in the programa and to prove the part that use the stock ID and gives to you only this stock you can insert a line puts Stock.getStock(id)
where id is the name betwen "" that you want to search.

HAVE A NICE DAY
